## Jupyter Notebooks for Python Learning

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) provide an interactive computing environment that's widely used in the Python community for data analysis, machine learning, and educational purposes. The combination of live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text makes Jupyter Notebooks an excellent tool for learning Python and exploring data.

### Installing Jupyter Notebooks

1. **Install Jupyter:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Make sure your virtual env is active
   - Run the following command to install Jupyter using pip:
     ```bash
     $ pip install jupyter
     ```

### Launching Jupyter Notebooks

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create or open a Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Launch Jupyter:**
   - Run the following command to start the Jupyter Notebook server:
     ```bash
     $ jupyter notebook
     ```

   - Your default web browser will open, displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

3. **Create a New Notebook:**
   - Click on the "New" button and choose "Python 3" to create a new Python 3 notebook.

4. **Write and Run Code:**
   - In a Jupyter Notebook, code is organized into cells. You can write code in a cell, then run the cell to see the output.
   - Use `Shift + Enter` to run a cell.

### Jupyter Notebook Features

- **Markdown Cells:**
  - Besides code cells, you can use Markdown cells to add formatted text, images, and links to your notebook. This makes Jupyter Notebooks an excellent tool for creating interactive documents.

- **Visualization:**
  - Jupyter supports the inline display of charts and graphs using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, allowing you to visualize data within your notebook.

- **Interactive Learning:**
  - Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in education due to their ability to combine code, explanations, and visualizations. This makes them great for interactive learning and sharing knowledge.

- **Export Options:**
  - You can export your Jupyter Notebooks in various formats, including HTML, PDF, and slideshows. This flexibility makes it easy to share your work with others.

### Your First Jupyter Notebook

1. **Create a New Notebook:**
   - Open Jupyter Notebook and create a new Python 3 notebook.

2. **Write Code:**
   - In a code cell, write your Python code. For example:
     ```python
     print("Hello, Jupyter!")
     ```

3. **Run Code:**
   - Run the code cell using `Shift + Enter`.

4. **Markdown Text:**
   - Add a Markdown cell and include formatted text to explain your code or provide additional context.

5. **Explore and Learn:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebooks to explore Python concepts, experiment with code, and enhance your understanding of programming.

Certainly! Here's an additional section on how to open Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code:

6. **Opening Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code:**
   
   Visual Studio Code provides excellent support for Jupyter Notebooks, allowing you to seamlessly work with both code and Markdown cells within the same environment.
   
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or using the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + X`.
   - Search for "Jupyter" in the Extensions view search box.
   - Install the one provided by Microsoft, which is the official Jupyter extension.
   - Once the extension is installed, open the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) or create a new one in Visual Studio Code.
   - You can create a new Jupyter Notebook by using the command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and selecting "Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook."

The `example.ipynb` file has some more examples of how to use these jupyter notebooks. It has code snippets from module 2.3 of the course.
As you can see we can run cells and modify the code dynamically. It helps also to visualize the data and the results of the code.
